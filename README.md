The Crystal Guessing game is a game that randomly assigns a number value between 1 - 12 to the 4 different crystal pictures.

Each cyrstal has a different value that will be generated with each iteration of the game.

There is also a random winning number that will be generated with a value between 9 and 120 that will be reset with each iteration of the game.

The goal is to click on the individual crystal pictures to add their values together to try to get to the winning number.

The game will end and reset after each loss or win.
A win will be counted if you successfully add the values to match the winning number. If you go over the winning number value, you will lose the round.

The round will not end until you either win or lose the round. Wins and losses are accumulated and will not reset after each iteration of the game.
